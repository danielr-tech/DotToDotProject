## Plotting the points

You should now have a list of coordinates.

You can plot your coordinates with `ListPlot`.

--- task ---

Plot your coordinates.

```
ListPlot[<coordinates>]
```

--- /task ---

This should already look a bit like a dot-to-dot!
Let's see what the solution looks like by joining all of the dots up.

--- task ---

Join up the coordinates in your plot with the `Joined` option.

```
ListPlot[<coordinates>, Joined -> True]
```

--- /task ---

It's not perfect, but its not bad either!
