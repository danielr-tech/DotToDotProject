- Can you simplify the starting image to get a cleaner result?
Hint: try `Blur`, `Rasterize` or `Binarize`.

- Can you join the last dot back to the first?
Hint: use `Part` to find the last point (see the advanced tips in "Explaining Part"), and `Join` it to the list of points.

- Can you make all of the callouts visible?
Hint: use the LabelVisibility option of `Callout`.

- Can you reorder the points to achieve a more appealing solution?
Hint: use `Part` to reorder the points (see the advanced tips in "Explaining Part").

- Can you make the dot-to-dot use a smaller number of points?
Hint: use `ArrayResample[<points>, <number>]`.
